# Capture the flag game

## Kata Context

Suppose you are a game company, and you have a game called Capture the flag. This game is played by
teams and each team can have many players. 

To narrow the scope of kata, suppose you have just to create a configurator that will be used
in the backend of the game called by the mobile app that is our front end.

There are many things you may want to configure: the number of maps a player can see and those can vary if
the player is already on a team or not, or can vary per team level (team level can go from 1 to 100).

How can you solve the configuration problem?
