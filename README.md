# Capture the flag game

## Kata Context

Suppose you are a game company and you have a game called Capture the flag. This game is played buy
teams and each team can have many players. 

To make the scope of kata narrow, suppose you have just to create a configurator that will be used
in the backend of the game called by the mobile app (our front end).

There are many things you can configuure: the number of maps a player can see and those can vary if
the player is already on a team or not, or per team level (team level can go from 1 to 100).

How can you solve the configuration problem?
